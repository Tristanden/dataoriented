# Demo data-oriented programming enabled with Java21

Implement summing binary trees, where only leaves have values.

``` 
Tree := Node | Leaf
Node := Tree x Tree
Leaf := Int
```

## Object-oriented approach

1. Implement sum as a method of the ITree interface
2. Implement sum through a visitor pattern
3. Implement sum with a dedicated service using *instance of* constructs


## Data-oriented approach

- Use records, sealed interfaces, Record Pattern & switch expressions
