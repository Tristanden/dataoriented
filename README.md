# dataoriented


Demo data oriented approach enabled in Java21

Implement summing binary trees, where only leaves have values.
Tree := Node | Leaf
Node := Tree x Tree
Leaf := Int



## Object-oriented approach

- Implement sum as a method of the ITree interface
- Implement sum through a visitor pattern
- Implement sum with a dedicated service using 'instance of' constructs


##Â Data-oriented approach

- Use records, sealed interfaces, Record Pattern & switch expressions
